"""Export the run's results from the database to readable files in outputs/exports/.

The pipeline's real output is the PostgreSQL database (the single source of truth).
This script dumps the key tables to CSV so the results can be read without the database
or the web console — open them in Excel. Re-runnable any time after a run.
