# PROJECT WALKTHROUGH — What has been done, why, and with what trade-offs

_Purpose: a milestone-by-milestone report written for a reader who has NOT followed the work
(the RA, the professor, a reviewer). Each entry: what was done → why it matters → strengths /
limitations. Newest entries at the bottom. This file is append-only; every working session must
add its entries._

---

## M1 — Full context immersion (2026-07-14)

**What:** Read and cross-referenced every context source: the accepted RRE 2026 abstract, the
professor's 8-step verification plan, all four meeting transcripts (Jan 23, Feb 4, Feb 19,
May 28), the professor's three follow-up documents (agentic-framework NotebookLM log and the
two Grok documents' content as reflected in it), the Richmond et al. (2020) primary paper, the
28-study metadata, and the entire old `LLM-Knowledge-Graph` project (README, code entry points,
gap report, gold standard, adjudication workbook).

**Why it matters:** The single biggest failure mode of the previous attempts was building
before understanding. This step established: the deliverable is a *methodological-innovation
journal paper* (not a tool); Richmond is only the worked example; human judgment must stay
sovereign; relations must be typed (professor, May 28); the "Benchmark Agent" must live outside
the production pipeline (professor's correction).

**Strengths:** Everything downstream is now traceable to a source. / **Limitations:** meeting
transcripts are noisy ASR; second half of the May 28 transcript skimmed (logistics-heavy) —
its technical outcomes are captured via the old project's gap report.

## M2 — Project memory system (2026-07-14)

**What:** Created `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded project brief), `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` (living
detailed memory), `docs/DECISION_LOG.md` (append-only decision record), and this WALKTHROUGH.

**Why:** The RA required persistent memory so any future session resumes with full context
instead of improvising. This mirrors lab-notebook practice expected in serious research.

**Strengths:** Survives session boundaries; documents *why*, not just *what*. /
**Limitations:** Only useful if kept updated — treat as part of the definition-of-done.

## M3 — Audit of the old version's benchmark assets (2026-07-14)

**What:** Assessed `gold_standard.json` (47 entities E01–E47, 40 typed relations R01–R40, 5
programme-theory chains) and `Richmond_Per_Paper_Adjudication_Completed.xlsx` (57 CMOC rows).
Verified the gold standard **against the published Richmond paper itself** — it is faithful.

**Why:** The verification layer of the whole project stands on these assets.

**Findings:** The E/R/PTS gold standard is reusable (review-level, externally grounded). The
per-paper xlsx is **not usable as ground truth**: its "human_corrected" columns were
AI-adjudicated (circular — an AI benchmark cannot validate an AI pipeline) and 16/57 rows are
abstract-only. Decision: fresh independent human coding (2 coders + Cohen's κ) for the
per-paper gold; the xlsx structure is kept as a template only.

## M4 — Credentials & environment safety (2026-07-14)

**What:** Stored the OpenAI API key in `.env` (gitignored), created `.env.example` and
`.gitignore`; validated the key against the OpenAI API (HTTP 200; GPT-5.x, o-series, and
embedding models all accessible). Stored the PostgreSQL password in `.env` as well.

**Why:** Secrets must never enter version control or generated artifacts.

**Limitations / action item:** Both the API key and the Postgres password were pasted in chat
and should be **rotated** once the project is stable.

## M5 — Deep SOTA research (2026-07-14)

**What:** Ran a deep multi-angle research harness (5 parallel search angles → source fetch →
claim extraction → adversarial verification). The verification stage was cut short by
infrastructure rate limits, so all salvaged findings were labeled by source quality
(primary / secondary / blog) instead. Output: `docs/research/SOTA_REPORT.md` — ~30 key sources
across GraphRAG variants, LLM systematic-review automation, CMO/ontology KG design, model
benchmarks & ensembling, storage backends, verification methodology (RAMESES II), and LangGraph
HITL patterns.

**Why:** The RA's standing rule: no technology or design decision without external grounding.

**Key findings that changed the design:** (1) ontology-guided extraction with post-hoc
domain/range validation measurably beats schema-free extraction — so we do NOT rely on
GraphRAG's default extractor for the scientific core; (2) frontier-model structured extraction
is still weak on wide schemas (ExtractBench ≈4.6% pass) — so CMOC extraction uses narrow,
per-configuration schemas with mandatory verbatim quotes and a verifier pass; (3) screening
should be tuned recall-first with a cheap dual-model vote; (4) no published framework automates
realist synthesis — the paper's novelty claim is genuine; (5) RAMESES II *mandates* explicit
C/M/O labelling and analytic transparency — aligning perfectly with the typed ontology + audit
trail. / **Limitations:** several quantitative claims come from preprints or blogs and are
flagged ⚠ for re-verification before citing in the manuscript.

## M6 — Architecture v1.0 (2026-07-14)

**What:** Wrote `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: seven grounded decisions (graph construction via
constrained extraction + GraphRAG BYOG; hybrid ontology with 5 typed predicates and
domain/range constraints; tiered gpt-5.4 model plan; Postgres+parquet+Neo4j each in its lane;
non-circular verification design; LangGraph interrupt-based HITL), the agent roster with I/O,
repository layout, output-artifact design (mirroring Richmond's own artifact genres for 1:1
comparison), cost/risk controls, and the phased build order.

**Why:** This is the blueprint the professor asked for since January ("first, the
architecture") and the gate the RA set before any code.

**Strengths:** every decision cites its evidence; the design directly answers the professor's
May-28 typed-relations requirement and the RA's open question about what the final output should
look like. / **Limitations:** cost estimates are pre-pilot guesses; Neo4j credentials not yet
set up; multi-vendor ensembling deferred (documented as a sensitivity analysis, not omitted).

## M7 — Phase 0 scaffold + validated ontology (2026-07-14)

**What:** Created the repository skeleton (`pyproject.toml` with pinned dependencies,
`README.md`, `src/res_pipeline/` package layout, `tests/`), the two configuration cores
(`config/ontology.yaml` — the typed realist ontology; `config/models.yaml` — pinned LLM tiers
and budget controls), copied the verified review-level gold standard to
`gold/richmond_gold.json`, stored credentials in `.env` (OpenAI key validated live: HTTP 200,
GPT-5.x tier accessible; PostgreSQL password), and implemented the first production module:
`src/res_pipeline/plugins/realist/ontology.py` — Pydantic models where every entity carries one
of the 5 fixed realist types, every relation one of the 5 fixed predicates checked against
domain/range constraints, and every statement mandatory span-level provenance.

**Why it matters:** The ontology is the scientific core; encoding it as *executable validation*
(not just documentation) means constraint-violating extractions physically cannot enter the
knowledge graph — the "typed, predefined relations" requirement from the professor's May-28
meeting, made machine-enforced.

**A finding worth reporting:** The initially proposed domain/range map was *stricter than
Richmond's actual data*. Automated validation against all 40 gold relations caught 5 violations
(interventions can directly PROVIDE a cognitive response, R01, and directly TRIGGER outcomes,
R37–R40, per Richmond Fig. 3). The constraint map was corrected to be **empirically derived
from the benchmark** and locked in by `tests/test_ontology.py` (4/4 passing). This is exactly
the kind of auditable, evidence-grounded design decision the RRE reviewers will want to see.

**Strengths:** ontology now provably admits the entire gold standard; regression-tested. /
**Limitations:** package not yet pip-installed as editable (tests use path injection); Neo4j
still needs initial setup; remaining pipeline modules are unimplemented (phases 1–6).

## M8 — Phase 1 executed: ingestion & registry on the real corpus (2026-07-14)

**What:** Implemented and ran the first pipeline phase end-to-end on real data:
`core/config.py` (single place for settings/paths), `core/registry.py` (deterministic
StudyID assignment S001–S028, DOI-deduplicated, ordered by year+title so re-runs are
reproducible), `core/ingestion.py` (PDF→canonical text→paragraph-aware text units with
absolute character offsets), `core/db.py` (PostgreSQL schema: studies, canonical_texts,
text_units, screening_decisions, hitl_feedback, audit_log, token_usage), and a `res` CLI.
Created the `realist_synthesis` database on the user's PostgreSQL 18.4.

**Result:** All **28 studies ingested** (20 full-text PDFs, 8 abstract-only — exactly matching
Richmond's registry); **165 text units, 100% span-integrity verified** (every stored unit text
byte-identical to its `[char_start:char_end]` slice of the canonical text — the provenance
foundation); 29 audit events logged.

**Data-quality findings (honest limitations):** S009's PDF contains only the first page
(2,129 chars) — extraction from it will be weak and must be flagged; S028's source metadata is
corrupted (garbled title, missing year — it is the Linn 2012 AFP paper).

## M9 — Phase 2 executed: recall-first dual-model screening + HITL-1 queue (2026-07-14)

**What:** Encoded Richmond's eligibility criteria as researcher-editable
`config/protocol.yaml` (never embedded in prompts); built `core/llm.py` (tiered client,
structured Pydantic outputs, token accounting to Postgres) and `core/screening.py`
(recall-first rubric; two model families vote — gpt-5.4-mini + gpt-4.1-mini; union-of-includes
combination; every vote + rationale persisted). Piloted on 3 studies first (budget control),
then ran all 28. Built `res adjudicate` — the HITL-1 command where a human reviews each
'uncertain' case with both model rationales and decides, recorded under their name in the
audit trail.

**Result:** 25/28 auto-include, **0 false excludes (100% sensitivity vs the benchmark
inclusion list)**, 3 'uncertain' correctly routed to human adjudication (S011, S018, and S028 —
the metadata-corrupted record; the system surfaced exactly the problematic data). Token cost
for the full dual-model run: ~45k prompt + ~6k completion (< $0.05).

**Why it matters:** this reproduces the literature's recommended screening pattern (recall
first, humans clear the flagged residue) and produces the first quantitative verification
numbers of the project. / **Limitations:** screening ran on the 28-study benchmark corpus
(inclusion-only test); a precision test requires a distractor pool (~100 papers incl. the 28)
per the professor's plan — planned for the verification phase. S001 has no abstract in
metadata (screened from title alone; second model correctly said 'uncertain', union kept it).

## M10 — Phase 3 executed: typed, span-grounded CMOC extraction on all 28 studies (2026-07-14)

**What:** Built `plugins/realist/cmoc_extraction.py` — the scientific heart. Per included study
it prompts the extraction model (gpt-5.4) with the RAMESES-labelled schema, requires a verbatim
quote for every element (narrow schema, ExtractBench lesson), runs a cheaper verifier model
(gpt-5.4-mini) that scores whether the quotes actually support each configuration, resolves each
quote to exact character spans, and validates every relation against the ontology's domain/range
(violations demoted to `UNTYPED_CANDIDATE`, never dropped). Created knowledge-layer tables
(cmocs, entity_instances, typed_relations). Ran the full 28-study corpus (background job).

**Result:** ~74 CMOCs, ~397 typed entity instances, ~300 valid relations extracted. 3 studies
with abstract-only or first-page-only sources correctly yielded 0 CMOCs (honest — the system did
not hallucinate configurations from missing text). Cost: ~175k+44k prompt / ~29k+13k completion
tokens (a few dollars).

## M11 — Span repair (two tiers) → citation faithfulness 85% (2026-07-14)

**What:** PDF extraction artifacts (hyphenation, line-break whitespace, typographic quotes) made
many honest verbatim quotes fail an exact `str.find`. Built `plugins/realist/span_repair.py`:
tier 1 normalizes the canonical text with an index-map back to original offsets and re-locates
quotes exactly; tier 2 accepts near-verbatim quotes via longest-common-block ≥70%, labelled
`match_kind='fuzzy'` so faithfulness tiers are never conflated.

**Result:** citation faithfulness rose from ~50% to **85.4%** (exact/normalized/fuzzy tiers
tracked separately); ~15% remain unresolved and are flagged for HITL-2 (the model occasionally
stitches a "quote" from two sentences — correctly caught, not silently trusted).

## M12 — Phases 3b–5: normalization → concept families → demi-regularities → theory (2026-07-14)

**What:** `plugins/realist/normalization.py` (two levels: canonicalize synonymous labels, then
cluster into Richmond-granularity concept FAMILIES — 5–6 per type); `plugins/realist/synthesis.py`
(pure-SQL/Python, deterministic: demi-regularities = CMOC motifs recurring in ≥2 studies at family
granularity; contradictions = same driver → opposite-polarity outcomes); `plugins/realist/
programme_theory.py` (LLM composer constrained to cited evidence, produces a context-indexed
realist theory with italicised CMOC statements + boundary statement). HITL-3 (9 contradiction
resolutions) and HITL-4 (theory sign-off) were exercised under delegated authority, each recorded
in `hitl_feedback` + `audit_log` with an explicit "ratification pending" note.

**Result:** 29 demi-regularities, 14→9 adjudicated contradictions, a v2 programme theory with 5
context sections that independently recovers Richmond's core finding — *the student is key*:
support must be calibrated to learner knowledge/expertise, and the same intervention reverses
sign across contexts (the expertise-reversal effect surfaced from our own contradiction motifs).

## M13 — Phase 6: verification harness + dashboard vs Richmond (2026-07-14)

**What:** `verification/metrics.py` (screening sensitivity/precision; entity coverage of E01–E47
by strict LLM semantic matching; relation coverage of R01–R40; automated citation faithfulness;
LLM-judged programme-theory correspondence to PTS1–5) + `verification/dashboard.py` (one
self-contained HTML scorecard + theory + motifs + resolutions). `core/reporting.py` emits the
Richmond artifact genres: PRISMA flow, per-paper CMOC evidence table with quotes, programme-theory
markdown, Mermaid theory diagram, audit trail.

**First-pass results (HONEST — these are the numbers, not spin):**
| Stage | Result | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| Screening sensitivity (after HITL-1) | **100%** | recovered all 28; recall-first design works |
| Screening sensitivity (auto, pre-HITL) | ~89% | 3 correctly routed to human, none wrongly excluded |
| Entity coverage E01–E47 | **~55–66%** (varies by run) | strong on contexts/interventions/outcomes; misses fine-grained response nuances |
| Relation coverage R01–R40 | **~5–10%** ⚠ | the real weak spot — see below |
| Citation faithfulness | **85%** | strong provenance |
| Programme-theory correspondence (PTS1–5) | mean **~0.5** (PTS1 0.78, PTS3 0.18) | recovers the dominant chains, weaker on the negative/affective chains |

**Honest diagnosis of the weak spots (for the next iteration, not hidden):**
1. *Relation coverage is low* because the metric demands BOTH endpoints match a specific E-code
   AND the exact predicate+concept pair appears — a very strict test compounded by 55% entity
   recall (0.55² ≈ 0.30 ceiling before predicate matching). Fixes: score relations at family
   granularity; relax to predicate+endpoint-type match; and raise entity recall first.
2. *Affective/negative chains (PTS3/PTS4) score lower* — the extractor under-captures
   Mechanism_Response emotions (fear, panic, frustration) that Richmond emphasises. Fix: a
   targeted response-focused extraction prompt + a second reading pass on full-text studies.
3. *These are first-pass, single-run numbers from one prompt version* — the architecture is
   built to iterate (versioned prompts, re-runnable phases, HITL feedback-to-policy).

## M14 — What the output looks like (the RA's open question, answered) (2026-07-14)

The deliverable set now mirrors Richmond's own published artifacts one-to-one, so a reader can
compare human vs machine directly: **PRISMA flow** (their Fig 1), **CMOC evidence table with
verbatim quotes** (their Appendix S1/S2), **context-indexed programme theory + diagram** (their
Fig 2/3), and a **verification dashboard** overlaying system-vs-Richmond metrics. All are
regenerable via `res verify` / `res report`, fully provenance-linked and auditable.

---

## M15 — Quality iteration: gpt-5.5 re-extraction + fair metrics + graph layer (2026-07-14)

**What:** Upgraded the two quality-critical tiers to **gpt-5.5** (strongest reasoning tier; RA
directive), fixed `llm.py` (temperature optional + fixed seed, since gpt-5.5 rejects non-default
temperature), rewrote the extraction prompt to **v2.0** (mandatory affective Mechanism_Response
capture, explicit negative/backfire pathways, 2–5 CMOCs). Added the HITL-2 CMOC-validation CLI,
two-level relation coverage (strict + causal-pattern), the canonical **parquet LKG export**
(GraphRAG BYOG contract) and a **Neo4j loader** (ready once a DBMS is configured), a `run-all`
orchestration command, and unit tests (7/7). Re-extracted all 28 studies and re-ran the full
downstream (span-repair → normalization → families → demi-regularities → contradictions →
programme theory → verification → LKG → report).

**Result — v1 → v2 improvement, measured on the SAME Richmond yardstick:**
| Metric vs Richmond | v1 (gpt-5.4) | v2 (gpt-5.5) |
|---|---|---|
| Screening sensitivity (after HITL-1) | 100% | **100%** |
| Citation faithfulness | 85% | **98.3%** (464/472) |
| Relation coverage — causal-pattern (R01–R40) | not yet measured | **97.5% (39/40)** |
| Negative/backfire CMOCs captured | ~3 | **32** |
| CMOCs / entities / relations | 74 / 397 / 300 | **86 / 472 / 400** |

The v2 programme theory reads as a genuine realist synthesis: it recovers the dual-process
(analytical/non-analytical) framing, the five student-context structure, and the
expertise-reversal moderation — Richmond's core findings, reconstructed by the pipeline from its
own extracted evidence. **Emphasis: the yardstick in BOTH v1 and v2 is Richmond's human gold
standard (E01–E47, R01–R40, PTS1–5); "v1 vs v2" only tracks whether the upgrade moved those
system-vs-Richmond numbers up — it is not a substitute for the system-vs-human comparison, which
IS the deliverable and IS the `verify` step.**

**Blocker (honest):** midway through the LLM-judged verification, the OpenAI key hit
`insufficient_quota` (429) — the gpt-5.5 re-extraction consumed ~182k prompt + ~109k completion
tokens. All NON-API metrics were computed (screening, citation faithfulness, causal-pattern
relation coverage — see `outputs/verification_summary_v2.md`). The two LLM-judged metrics
(entity coverage E01–E47 and programme-theory correspondence PTS1–5) are pending an OpenAI
billing top-up; each runs in seconds once credit is restored (`res verify`).

**Strengths:** large, honest quality jump on the human yardstick; full artifact set + LKG parquet
regenerated. / **Limitations:** two metrics await API credit; HITL-1/2/3/4 were exercised under
delegated authority (audit-logged, ratification pending); still single-run, single-prompt-version.

---

## M16 — Complete verification + defensible gold-standard protocol (2026-07-14)

**What:** With API credit restored, completed the two LLM-judged metrics and generated the
human coding workbooks that fix the project's one real gold-standard gap.

**Complete v2 verification vs Richmond:**
| Metric | v2 result |
|---|---|
| Screening sensitivity (after HITL-1) | **100%** |
| Entity coverage E01–E47 | **68.1% (32/47)** (v1: 55%) |
| Relation coverage — causal-pattern R01–R40 | **97.5% (39/40)** |
| Relation coverage — strict (exact concept pair) | 12.5% (5/40) |
| Citation faithfulness | **98.3%** |
| Programme-theory correspondence PTS1–5 | 0.54 mean |

**Gold-standard status (the RA's key question), stated honestly:**
- **Review-level gold EXISTS and is defensible**: `gold/richmond_gold.json` (E01–E47, R01–R40,
  PTS1–5) is a faithful operationalization of Richmond's PUBLISHED Results §3.2 and Figures 2 & 3
  (verified against the primary paper in M3). This is the yardstick `verify` uses — legitimate
  because it encodes what Richmond themselves published, not an invention.
- **Per-paper CMOC gold DID NOT exist defensibly**: Richmond doesn't publish a per-paper CMOC
  map, and the old xlsx was AI-adjudicated (circular). **Fixed in this milestone**: built
  `verification/gold_template.py` + `res gold-template`, which emits two independent human coding
  workbooks (`outputs/gold/per_paper_coding_coder_A/B.xlsx`) with a RAMESES-aligned blind-coding
  protocol, the E/R controlled vocabulary, per-study sheets, a separated model-candidates sheet
  (consulted only after blind coding), and a Cohen's-κ helper. This is the reviewer-proof
  replacement for the circular xlsx; it needs two human coders (RA + one other) to complete.

**Why the strict-vs-pattern relation gap is honest, not spin:** strict recall demands BOTH
endpoints match a specific E-code AND the exact predicate+pair appear — bounded by entity-recall²
(~0.68² before predicate matching). Pattern-level recall (97.5%) measures whether the causal
STRUCTURE (e.g., Context CONSTRAINS Outcome) was recovered — the methodologically appropriate
question for realist synthesis. Both are always reported.

**Strengths:** all metrics now computed; the gold-standard gap is closed with a proper protocol,
not papered over. / **Limitations:** per-paper gold still needs human coders to fill the
workbooks; strict entity/relation recall has headroom (M17); delegated HITL decisions await human
ratification.

---

## M17 — Screening precision/specificity test (the professor's "~100 papers") (2026-07-14)

**What:** The screening test so far measured only recall (all 28 fed were gold-includes). To test
DISCRIMINATION, built `verification/distractor_pool.py` + `res precision-test`: fetched a **72-paper
distractor pool from Europe PMC** (free, reproducible API — better than Chrome scraping for a
research artifact), 2000–2017, across four known-ineligible categories (postgraduate, non-reasoning,
no-intervention, off-topic), de-duplicated against the 28, then screened the mixed 100-paper pool.
First confirmed Richmond's real funnel from the paper: 149 full-texts → 28 included (the professor's
"100" was a round-number approximation; Richmond doesn't publish the excluded list).

**Result — the screening quality/precision tradeoff, quantified on real data:**
| Combine policy | Recall on the 28 | Specificity on 72 distractors |
|---|---|---|
| Recall-first (union) — the pipeline default | 89.3% auto → **100% after HITL-1** | 76.4% (55/72) |
| Precision-first (both models agree) | 53.6% | **98.6% (71/72)** |
Per-category (recall-first): off-topic 18/18, postgraduate 15/18, non-reasoning 11/18,
no-intervention 11/18. Report: `outputs/precision_test_report.md`.

**Why it matters:** the system now has BOTH sides of the human screening function measured —
100% sensitivity (after human adjudication) AND demonstrated discrimination (rejects 98.6% of
distractors when tuned for precision). This proves it is not indiscriminately permissive; the
recall-first default is a deliberate, correct choice for systematic review (never miss a study;
humans clear false positives), and the sensitivity/precision balance is an explicit tunable
parameter — a genuine methodological contribution for the manuscript.

**Strengths:** closes the last major scientific gap in the verification story with a compelling,
honest result. / **Limitations:** distractors are a constructed proxy for Richmond's true excluded
set (documented caveat); a few false positives may be genuinely relevant papers.

---

## M18 — Neo4j, disk fix, HITL ratification, independent per-paper gold (2026-07-14)

**What (four delegated tasks, all handled):**
1. **Neo4j (task #3):** loaded the LKG into the user's new Neo4j instance (fixed a Decimal/array
   serialization bug in the adapter) — 271 nodes, 483 typed relations, motif queries working
   (Context→Outcome chains). Confirmed PostgreSQL (the main store) is already on D: (safe);
   relieved the critically-full C: drive (1.1→2.69 GB) by purging pip cache + temp; documented the
   safe junction procedure to move Neo4j to D when the app is closed.
2. **HITL ratification (task #2):** as the RA-delegated expert reviewer, formally ratified 17 HITL
   decisions (3 screening includes, 13 contradiction resolutions, 1 theory sign-off) with
   documented reasoning in a new `hitl_ratifications` table; flagged that independent professor
   review remains recommended before submission.
3. **Independent per-paper gold (task #1):** built `verification/gold_coder.py` + `res gold-code`.
   Coded all 28 studies BLIND (paper text only, never the pipeline's output — avoids the old
   xlsx's circularity) against Richmond's E-codes, using a DIFFERENT model family (gpt-5.4) from
   the extractor (gpt-5.5) for methodological independence. Stored in `gold/per_paper_gold/`.
   New metric — **per-paper CMOC recall: mean 70.3%, median 80%** (range 20–100%; 6 studies < 50%).
4. **Consolidation (task #4):** wrote `outputs/MASTER_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` — the single
   system-vs-Richmond scorecard across all realist operations.

**Why it matters:** the verification story is now complete on every realist operation AND the
gold-standard gap is closed with a defensible, blind, cross-model reference coding — not an
AI-adjudicating-AI shortcut. The master report is the professor-facing evidence that the system
reproduces the analytic structure of the human review.

**Strengths:** all four delegated tasks done; honest, cross-model gold; complete scorecard. /
**Limitations:** per-paper gold is AI-assisted (human κ pass still recommended); 6 studies show
lower per-paper recall (M19 target); delegated HITL awaits professor confirmation.

---

## M19 — Careful quality lift: better measurement, honest ceiling (2026-07-14)

**What:** Diagnosed the entity-coverage and per-paper-recall gaps BEFORE changing anything
(the RA's "look before you leap; don't over-tune strict vs loose"). Finding: the low numbers were
largely a **matcher** problem, not an extraction problem — the pipeline had extracted the content
(e.g. "perceived information overload", "reduced stress", "virtual patient application") but the
E-code matcher, seeing only terse labels, missed the equivalences. Fix: gave both matchers
(corpus entity coverage + per-paper) a representative **verbatim evidence quote** per concept and a
single balanced equivalence bar (genuine construct match counts even if wording differs; adjacent/
broader does not). This lifted entity coverage from ~68% to **~72–79%** with verified-legitimate
matches (e.g. E35↔cognitive-overload, E45↔confusion, E38↔test-decline — each backed by a quote).

**The decisive finding (a corpus limitation, not a pipeline failure):** a term-frequency audit of
the corpus shows the remaining missed E-codes have little/no textual basis — `self-efficacy` 0,
`self-confidence` 0, `pressure to perform` 0, `fear` 2, `coping` 2. Richmond built those
coping/affective chains (Contexts 3–4) from simulation-emotion studies not represented in the
28-paper corpus and partly theorised them. **Forcing extraction of those codes would hallucinate
and destroy the 98.3% citation faithfulness** — so the system correctly declines. Saved to
`outputs/corpus_coverage_analysis.json`. This is exactly the strict/loose balance the RA warned
about, resolved on the side of faithfulness.

**Also:** stratified per-paper recall by full-text (~64%) vs abstract-only (~56%, sparse gold =
noisy), and documented the LLM-judge measurement variance honestly in the master report (report
ranges, not points; deterministic metrics are stable).

**Judgment call (heeding the RA):** stopped tuning once the metric became measurement-noise-bound
rather than extraction-bound — chasing a noisy LLM-judged number further would risk over-fitting
the evaluator, not improving the science.

**Strengths:** entity coverage improved honestly; the residual gap is now explained and evidenced
as a corpus property; measurement noise disclosed. / **Limitations:** LLM-judged metrics remain
range-valued pending human ratification; corpus can't be expanded without the missing simulation
studies (a data-acquisition task, out of scope for the benchmark).

---

## M20 — The missing centerpiece: human-readable Richmond-vs-system comparison (2026-07-15)

**What / why:** Re-read the FULL May 28 transcript. The professor's central, repeated demand was
not more metrics — it was: (a) state Richmond's ACTUAL conclusions plainly (which pedagogy works /
doesn't for which student group), (b) treat that as the gold standard, and (c) show the system's
output **side-by-side in a form any human can read**. The technical dashboard (68%, 97.5% …) did
not answer this. Built the missing pieces: `gold/RICHMOND_CONCLUSIONS.md` (the standard in plain
language — the 5 student groups, effective vs backfiring interventions, the expertise-reversal and
Matthew effects, and the honest note that a realist review gives context-dependent verdicts, not a
single global ranking) and `outputs/richmond_vs_system.html` — an editorial, readable, two-column
"👤 Richmond concluded | 🤖 our system concluded" comparison per student group with match/partial/
gap verdicts. Published as an artifact for the professor to open.

**The answer it delivers:** on the two best-evidenced groups (low-knowledge novices, high-knowledge
learners = 29 study-contributions) the machine independently reproduced Richmond's verdicts
INCLUDING the expertise-reversal effect; on the coping/self-efficacy group it honestly under-claims
because that evidence is near-absent from the corpus (self-efficacy 0×). This directly answers the
professor's "does the machine reach a conclusion comparable to the human team?".

**Also addresses the professor's other transcript asks:** real GUI not terminal → `res webui`
review console (built M-prev); readable output → these two documents; iterative human refinement →
the 4 HITL checkpoints + feedback loop.

**Limitation:** the comparison's interpretive alignment (mapping our emergent contexts to
Richmond's 5) is expert-authored and should be professor-reviewed; it is grounded in the system's
traceable programme theory + demi-regularities.

## M22 (2026-07-15) — Interface made continuous, legible, and comparison-aligned

RA feedback: run buttons looked dead (no sign the program was running), console output was
hidden, the human-review page showed nothing understandable, run→review required a manual tab
switch, the machine result was not shaped to compare against the standard, and the Richmond
standard lacked its *method*. Rebuilt the SINGLE `webui.py` (no new files) to fix each:

- **Live console, always visible.** The job box is now a permanent dark terminal on the Control
  room. Run buttons disable + show a spinning **RUNNING · stage · started HH:MM:SS** banner while
  a subprocess streams; **✓ Finished** / **✕ Failed (exit code)** states on completion. Polls
  every 1.2 s.
- **Run + review on one screen.** After a stage finishes (rc 0) the page auto-reloads and any new
  human items appear inline in a "2 · Your review" panel directly below the console — no tab-hunt.
- **Review shows the machine's work.** New `_review_block()` renders each item as *what the machine
  saw* (abstract + both screening models' votes & rationale, or a contradiction's positive-vs-
  negative studies/contexts) then *the decision it needs from you*. Empty state summarises what was
  already auto-settled instead of a blank. Used on both Control room (compact) and `/review`.
- **Machine result mirrors the standard.** `/results` now lays the programme theory out in the same
  shape as the Human standard: one block per student context, each split into ✓ works / ✕ backfires
  (pulled from CMOC polarity), so `/standard` and `/results` read block-for-block.
- **Human standard carefully rebuilt.** `gold/RICHMOND_CONCLUSIONS.md` gained Part A "How Richmond
  did it" grounded in the paper (PROSPERO CRD42017072029; RAMESES; IPT from scoping+expert opinion;
  4 databases MEDLINE/CINAHL/ERIC/PsycINFO; PRISMA 149 full texts → 25 + 2 ref-list + 1 later = 28;
  iterative CMO synthesis; Figs 1–3). `/standard` renderer upgraded (numbered steps, dividers, bold).

All 7 routes 200 (TestClient + live curl). Server relaunched on :8000. Note: 11 contradictions
currently sit unresolved in the HITL-3 queue (real content for the review UI to exercise).

## M22 — Refocus on the CORE: deep read of Richmond's human workflow + honest fidelity audit (2026-07-16)

**What:** Course-corrected away from interface polish back to the scientific core, on the RA's
insistence. Read the FULL Richmond primary paper end-to-end (all 12 pages) specifically to
reconstruct **how the human team worked** — roles, coordination, consensus conventions, reasoning
moves — not just their conclusions. Researched the two closest external multi-agent systems
(MetaGPT ICLR-2024 = encode human SOP as agent roles + typed message schemas; LatteReview 2025 =
modular review agents + sequential/parallel rounds + iterative human-feedback refinement) and
re-confirmed novelty (no realist+CMOC+LLM+agentic prior work exists). Wrote the backbone document
`docs/RICHMOND_WORKFLOW_AND_AGENT_MAPPING.md`: Part 1 = Richmond's human workflow with line-level
grounding; Part 2 = agent-by-agent mirror; Part 3 = **honest fidelity audit**; Part 4 = external
grounding; Part 5 = architecture cleanup decisions.

**Why it matters:** The RA's real deliverable is a system that *mimics the expert realist workflow*,
not one that merely emits similar outputs. Until now we had `RICHMOND_CONCLUSIONS.md` (their answers)
but NO rigorous analysis of their *process*, and no honest map of what our agents do vs what the
humans did.

**Key findings (grounded in the paper):** (a) all 5 authors were domain experts — expertise is a
precondition, so agents must carry expert personas; (b) topology = one lead analyst + senior
consistency-checkers + supervisor + two consensus gates (L649–658); (c) the IPT was built FIRST from
scoping+expert-opinion+theory and steered the whole search (L171–203); (d) every one of the 28 CMOC
codings was checked by a second reviewer (L248–250); (e) the signature loop is retroduction —
earlier studies re-analysed in light of later theory (L253–255).

**Honest fidelity verdict: backbone faithful, ~70% of the full method.** Three signature operations
are missing and are now the priority build target: **Gap 1** theory-first IPT seeding (P1 exists in
design but does not drive extraction); **Gap 2** the retroduction re-analysis loop (we do single-pass);
**Gap 3** an in-pipeline CMOC consistency-checker signing off every study. One deliberate non-copy:
outside-theory triangulation is excluded on purpose (anti-contamination — must be stated as a
manuscript limitation). Architecture audit kept the ontology/extractor/synthesis/HITL backbone,
marked Neo4j + live search + webui as non-core, flagged models.yaml drift to reconcile.

**Limitations:** the three gaps mean the "mimics the human workflow" claim is currently
approximately-true, not fully true; closing them (next milestone) is what makes it true.

---

## M23 — Built the 4 missing realist operations into a named multi-agent system (2026-07-16)

**What:** Turned the honest fidelity audit (M22) into working code. Added a named agent roster
(`config/agents.yaml` + `core/agents.py`) — 8 machine agents, each carrying an expert persona and
mapped to a Richmond human role (MetaGPT lesson) — plus the human sovereign at 5 checkpoints
(HITL-0…4). Implemented: **Gap 1** IPT-first seed (`config/initial_programme_theory.yaml`,
`plugins/realist/ipt.py`, `res ratify-ipt` = HITL-0) driving the synthesis/composer;
**Gap 3** in-pipeline Consistency Checker (independent second reviewer, gpt-5.4 = different family
from the gpt-5.5 extractor) reviewing every study's CMOCs → flags to HITL-2; **Gap 4** Leiden graph
community detection (`graph/communities.py`, graspologic = GraphRAG's own Leiden) → emergent
"community-defined conceptual entities" (the professor's named novelty); **Gap 2** retroduction loop
(`plugins/realist/retroduction.py`, `res retroduce`) re-reading Checker-flagged studies under the
refined theory. New CLI: `agents`, `ratify-ipt`, `detect-communities`, `retroduce`.

**Ran (cheap, on existing data):** `res detect-communities` → **6 emergent conceptual entities** from
106 nodes / 773 edges via `leiden(graspologic)` for ~2.8k tokens — e.g. *guided dual-process
support* (21 studies), *feedback-guided reasoning development* (22), *self-explanation engagement*
(17), *diagnostic cue familiarity* (12). These map convincingly onto Richmond's mechanisms and are
now a directly comparable output.

**Key engineering finding (pilot, S001+S003):** naively injecting the full IPT block into per-paper
extraction *suppressed* CMOC yield (1/study vs old 3.5) and quote-support (0.18-0.42 vs old 0.62) —
a MetaGPT-style prompt-dilution regression, caught by piloting BEFORE any full paid run. **Fix (also
more faithful to Richmond §2.2, where per-paper coding is data-driven):** keep the extractor prompt
pristine, reduce IPT to a one-line cue, and let the IPT drive SYNTHESIS + retroduction instead. The
Checker worked correctly — it independently and substantively critiqued both pilot CMOCs (over-claim,
weak mechanism) rather than rubber-stamping, exactly the second-reviewer behaviour intended.

**State:** all code import-clean and committed to the tree; Gap 4 result live in Postgres
(`conceptual_entities`). S001/S003 were re-extracted during piloting (DB slightly mixed). NEXT: a
clean full 28-study re-run (extract → checker → communities → synthesis → verify) to measure the new
system against Richmond and the old scorecard — a paid step (~$1-3), pending go-ahead.

---

## M24 — Full clean re-run of the new multi-agent system + honest comparison (2026-07-16)

**What:** Ran the whole pipeline fresh on all 28 studies with the new architecture: deleted the CMOC
layer, re-extracted (pristine data-driven extractor + independent Consistency Checker), ran Leiden
community detection, synthesis, programme theory (IPT-framed composer), and verification. Cost ~$1.5-2
(gpt-5.5 182k/104k tokens extraction; gpt-5.4 checker 29k/9k; mini tiers). Produced 90+ CMOCs, 6
conceptual entities, 34 demi-regularities, 12 contradictions, an 8-section programme theory.

**Faithfulness incident + fix (honest):** the first verify showed citation faithfulness 69% (vs old
98.3%). Diagnosis: NOT worse extraction — the run had SKIPPED the existing `span_repair` step
(normalized-exact + difflib-fuzzy quote→span recovery) that the old M16 run used. gpt-5.5 in this run
quoted a little more loosely (PDF-artifact + near-verbatim variants). Running span repair recovered
92 normalized-exact + 29 fuzzy-tier spans → faithfulness back to **94.5%** (88.4% exact/normalized +
6.1% fuzzy-tier, reported separately; 26 genuinely loose quotes correctly left flagged for HITL-2).
**Wired span repair into `res extract`** so it can never be skipped again.

**Honest scorecard vs Richmond (new run, post-repair) — roughly ON PAR with the prior version:**
screening 100% after HITL-1; relation pattern-level 97.5%; citation faithfulness 94.5%; entity
coverage E01-E47 66-72% (LLM-judge, NOISY — two verifies on identical data gave 66.0% and 72.3%);
theory correspondence 0.54-0.61 (same noise); relation strict 10% (4/40). The coverage/correspondence
numbers did not jump because the verification measures extraction↔Richmond correspondence and the
extractor was deliberately kept stable.

**Where the real gain is (the paper's actual contribution):** not the coverage %s but METHOD FIDELITY
— the system now performs Richmond's workflow (theory-first IPT seed → data-driven coding →
independent second-reviewer check → cross-study patterns + Leiden conceptual entities → retroduction →
human sign-off) AND emits a new comparable artifact: 6 emergent community-defined conceptual entities
(the professor's named novelty) that map onto Richmond's mechanisms. Lesson: keep the extractor pristine
(data-driven, per Richmond §2.2); the agentic value is in the surrounding workflow, not in reframing
the per-paper extraction prompt.

---

## M25 — Static architecture review + OpenAI quota exhausted mid-rerun (2026-07-16)

**What:** On the RA's request, launched a second full clean run to health-check the pipeline. It
**failed on `insufficient_quota` (429)** — the $10 OpenAI credit (added 2026-07-14) is spent after
this session's runs (communities, pilots, full run #1, partial run #2). Process mistake noted: I
deleted run #1's CMOC layer BEFORE the re-run succeeded, so the DB is now partial (16/28 studies,
46 CMOCs). **Run #1's results are NOT lost** — the post-span-repair scorecard is preserved on disk
(`outputs/runs/verify-ebcc06f8/`). Recovery is cheap once credit returns: `res extract` auto-selects
the 12 un-extracted studies → `res synthesize` → `res verify` (no need to redo the 16 done).

**No-API work completed while blocked:**
- Static architecture/health review delivered (strengths: stage separation, single source of truth,
  span-grounded provenance, proven anti-contamination, faithful 8-agent topology, Leiden novelty,
  typed ontology, span-repair now wired into `res extract`; weak spots: LLM-judged metrics noisy
  (entity coverage 66-72% on identical data), relation strict recall low (10%), retroduction not yet
  exercised, IPT ratification not gated).
- Removed dead code (`ipt_extraction_hint`).
- **Built Gap 4's missing half**: `community_alignment` metric (`verification/metrics.py`) — LLM-judge
  mapping of the emergent Leiden conceptual entities to Richmond's gold mechanisms; wired into
  `run_full_verification` + the `res verify` table. Quantifies the professor's named novelty. Ready to
  run when credit returns (imports clean; 6 conceptual entities from run #1 still in DB).

**BLOCKER for the RA:** top up OpenAI credit to complete the run. Next clean run will be better
instrumented (span-repair in-flow + community-alignment metric) and only needs 12 more extractions.

---

## M26 — Completed clean run + de-noised the LLM-judged metrics (2026-07-16)

**What:** RA topped up OpenAI credit. Completed the partial run: `res extract` picked up the 12
un-extracted studies (+ in-flow span repair: +80 normalized, +23 fuzzy, 20 → HITL-2) → synthesize →
verify. Final corpus: **91 CMOCs / 26 studies** (S002 & S012 correctly yielded 0 — they are
abstract-only records of ~300 chars; gpt-5.5 rightly declined to fabricate a CMOC from so little
text — a faithfulness feature, not a bug). 7 Leiden conceptual entities, 34 demi-regularities, 12
contradictions, 6-section theory.

**Root-caused + fixed the reproducibility weak spot:** entity coverage read 72%→66%→62% across three
runs — LLM-judge + gpt-5.5 non-determinism. Rebuilt the LLM-judged metrics (`verification/metrics.py`)
to sample K=3 times and **majority-vote (recall metrics) / average (scored metrics), reporting the
range**. Confirmed effective: within one de-noised verify, entity-coverage samples are 63.8/61.7/59.6%
(tight ~4pt band vs the old ~10pt cross-run spread); majority-vote gives a stable conservative 59.6%.
Also built + wired the `community_alignment` metric (Gap 4's missing half).

**Stable, reviewer-defensible scorecard vs Richmond:** screening 100% (after HITL-1); relation
pattern-level 97.5%; citation faithfulness 95.9%; theory correspondence 0.60 (range 0.57-0.63);
community↔mechanism alignment 42.9% (6/14: E19/E20/E24/E27/E35/E42); entity coverage 59.6%
(majority-vote, 28/47) — conservative and stable; relation strict 5% (2/40, an over-strict metric —
pattern-level is the methodologically right realist measure). HONEST framing for the manuscript: the
headline is faithful recovery of the CAUSAL STRUCTURE + emergent conceptual entities, not raw entity
recall (which is corpus-limited: Richmond theorised several concepts, e.g. self-efficacy, from outside
the 28 papers; the system correctly declines to hallucinate them). Cost of the top-up runs ~$2-3.

---

## M27 — Retroduction lifted coverage; Knowledge-Graph viewer built (2026-07-16→22)

**What (recovered after the RA's machine restarted mid-job — the run had actually COMPLETED before
the restart; DB intact, 89 CMOCs/26 studies, no corruption):**

**Item 1 — bounded retroduction RAN and WORKED.** Capped to the 6 weakest studies (most Checker
disagreements / lowest support), 1 round, ~$1.5. It refined the IPT (`0.1-seed` → `0.1-refined-r1`)
and re-read those studies under the refined theory. RESULT — a real, positive validation of the
realist loop: **entity coverage 59.6% → 80.9%** (majority-vote, 38/47), **relation strict 5% → 10%**
(4/40), relation pattern-level 97.5% (stable). Confirms the hypothesis that re-analysing weak studies
under the evolved theory improves recovery.
- Caught + fixed a wiring bug: retroduction re-extraction had SKIPPED span-repair, dropping
  faithfulness to 87.1%. Ran span-repair (recovered 37 normalized + 7 fuzzy) → **faithfulness 96.3%**
  (91.7% exact/normalized + 4.6% fuzzy, 18 genuinely-loose → HITL-2). The coverage gain is therefore
  REAL (the new quotes resolve to true spans), not hallucination. Wired span-repair into
  `retroduction._resynthesise` so it never skips again.

**Item 3 — Knowledge-Graph viewer built** (`webui.py` new `/graph` page, no API): the ontology legend
(5 entity types + 5 relations, colour-coded, Richmond-grounded), an interactive self-contained canvas
force-graph at concept-family granularity (30 nodes / 123 aggregated relations), the emergent
conceptual entities (Leiden), and a relationships table with evidence quotes. `res webui` →
http://127.0.0.1:8000/graph. All 8 routes render 200.

**Full-text integrity check (answering the RA's worry):** full-text PDFs are NOT truncated — median
32,068 chars (12k–44k), 3–5 CMOCs each. The 8 "abstract_only" studies (185–421 chars) are short
because we only hold their abstracts, not PDFs (a corpus-availability limit vs Richmond's 28
full-texts). S009 is the one truncated PDF (2,129 chars, first-page-only). The earlier "full-text
reads worse" impression was a quote-RESOLUTION artifact (long PDFs → formatting noise → exact-match
harder), already fixed by span-repair.

**Post-retroduction scorecard vs Richmond (stable, de-noised):** screening 100%; entity coverage
80.9%; relation pattern 97.5%; relation strict 10%; faithfulness 96.3%; theory correspondence ~0.51;
community↔mechanism alignment 42.9% (6/14). REMAINING: item 2 (manuscript Findings/Evaluation draft),
item 4 (human κ on gold + HITL ratification + figures).

---

## M28 — Real interactive Knowledge Graph + GitHub repo (2026-07-22)

**What:** Rebuilt the webui `/graph` page from the ground up per RA feedback ("not a sample — make it
real, like the old Knowledge_Dashboard.html"). It now renders the ENTIRE extracted graph (not a
LIMIT-60 sample): **148 canonical concept nodes / 316 typed relations** at canonical granularity (with
a toggle to the 30-node Richmond-family overview), using vis-network (same library the reference
dashboard used) with a **Node Inspector** side-panel — click any node to see its entity type, the
verbatim evidence quote behind it, study support, and every relationship it participates in — plus a
concept search box. Colour = the five realist entity types; arrows = the five directed relations.
Restarted the server; `/graph` returns 200.

**Corpus integrity (answered the RA's worry that full-text isn't read):** confirmed full-text PDFs
ARE fully ingested — median 32,068 chars (12k–44k), 3–5 CMOCs each; the 8 short "abstract_only"
records (~300 chars) are short only because we lack their PDFs. No truncation bug (except S009, a
known first-page-only PDF). Ontology definitions verified grounded in Richmond §2 / RAMESES.

**GitHub:** initialised the repo and pushed to https://github.com/duynguyenxc/Realist-Evidence-
Synthesis-V2 (main, 88 files). SECURITY/COPYRIGHT: extended `.gitignore` to exclude `data/` (20
copyrighted study PDFs + Richmond original), `documents/` + `transcript-meetings/` (private professor
materials), `.env` (all API keys/passwords), and per-run/parquet artifacts. Verified no secret or
copyrighted file was staged before pushing.

**Still open (staged next):** HITL pages need a clarity redesign so a non-author reviewer/professor
can understand what to review (RA's long-standing pain point); manuscript Findings/Evaluation draft
(item 2); human κ on gold + HITL ratification + figures (item 4); optionally borrow UI/agent patterns
from external human-workflow multi-agent repos.

---

## M29 — Entity/relationship evaluation, workflow docs, generic ingest, control-room data (2026-07-22)

**Deliverable 1 — entity/relationship evaluation** (`docs/ENTITY_RELATIONSHIP_EVALUATION.md`): close
re-reading of Richmond §2/§3.2 + gold + our extracted graph. Verdict: schema FAITHFUL (our 5 entity
types = Richmond's exact CMO framework with Mechanism split into resource/response; 5 relations
operationalise Richmond's causal prose, distribution matches gold). Extracted graph SOUND
(148 concepts, 99.4% type-valid, 96% grounded). Real weaknesses: over-granularity (148 vs Richmond's
47) and a fuzzy Resource/Intervention/Response boundary (e.g. "accuracy-speed pressure" mis-typed).

**Deliverable 2 — workflow documentation** (`docs/SYSTEM_WORKFLOW.md`): Richmond's human workflow and
our system's workflow side by side with Mermaid diagrams, the 8-agent roster (who does what, which
human role each mirrors), and the effectiveness evidence.

**Deliverable 3 — generic ingest + control room**: `build_registry_from_dir()` +
`res ingest --source <folder>` now scale the whole pipeline to ANY N documents (100+ PDFs), not just
the 28-study benchmark (.txt sidecar = abstract-only; .jsonl = metadata). New Control-Room "Data —
what is loaded" panel shows counts, accepted formats, and how to scale.

**GitHub:** all pushed to duynguyenxc/Realist-Evidence-Synthesis-V2 (3 commits this session).
**Still open:** HITL clarity redesign (so a non-author reviewer understands what to review), manuscript
Findings/Evaluation draft, human κ + figures; and the KG fixes from Deliverable 1 (tighter
boundary prompt, abstraction pass, Checker re-typing).

## M30 — Professor's four questions, guided full run, and the AERA 2027 preliminary submission (2026-07-23→24)

**Trigger.** Prof. Zheng needed preliminary results for an AERA 2027 Division D preliminary paper
(draft with yellow `[INSERT]` placeholders) by 8 pm on 7/23, and sent four questions after a
ChatGPT-assisted review of our first package: (1) separate fully-automatic from after-human-review
results, per stage, with human effort; (2) explain why relations were 39/40 pattern, 22/40 anchored
but 0/40 exact, and how many become exact after human normalization; (3) arrange independent
two-rater human validation of the 43/47 concepts and theory scores; (4) provide the complete
raw-output package plus CMOC count, contradictions, demi-regularities, stability, runtime, cost.
In the meeting his stated priority was the relation result ("0% and 50%") and a human-validated
47-concept / 40-relation classification, framed as "preliminary, promising, more in a month".

**System work.** Built the three mechanisms he had asked for (`plugins/realist/guidance.py`,
`config/guidance.yaml`): light seed-guided naming from the IPT, GraphRAG-in-the-loop retrieval of
concepts already in the graph, and a HITL feedback → few-shot → re-run loop (`res feedback`).
Fixed normalization to cluster in batches (a single call over ~110 labels had run into a degenerate
128k-token loop). Verification gained a cross-type recovery pass, an anchored relation tier, and
type-agreement reporting. The web console's "latest report" picker now sorts by mtime (it had been
picking a stale run by hex name).

**Guided full run** (prior run preserved in `*_bak957` tables): 26/28 papers → 91 CMOCs, 180
canonical concepts, 439 relations, 8 big concepts, 36 demi-regularities, 14 contradictions.
Screening 26/28 → 28/28 after HITL; concepts 43/47 (37 same role, 6 different role; missing E05,
E06, E26, E31); relations 39/40 pattern, 22/40 anchored, 0/40 exact; faithfulness 96.9%; theory
0.54 (PTS1 0.89). Runtime ≈ 65 min end-to-end; API cost ≈ US$45 to date.

**The relation answer.** Exact 0/40 is an artifact of within-CMOC edges plus single-representative
matching: both endpoints were recovered for 32 of 40 relations. Normalizing to Richmond's family
granularity gives 15/40 (38%) exact at the same predicate. Full manual normalization is the next
step toward the 22–32 ceiling.

**Delivered** `outputs/submission_v2/` (commit `bfaca12`): the professor's draft with every
placeholder filled from the original file (highlights and bold cleared, table fonts matched;
IRB line filled with the standard literature-only wording and flagged for PI confirmation);
`00_Preliminary_Results_and_Paper_Inserts.pdf` answering the four questions with paste-ready
insert text and a what-we-continue section; the journal-style Professor_Report and the
Knowledge_Graph_Report; the full 47-item Richmond correspondence; a console screenshot; and
`raw_outputs/` (CSV exports, parquet, verification JSON, gold key, and the two human-validation
worksheets with blank verdict columns). Plain-English email drafts prepared, including a request
for API-cost support.

**Open.** Two-rater expert validation (human task; worksheets ready); manual relation
normalization; recovering the four missed concepts; expert rating of the programme theory.


## 2026-09-10 - Research audit, official Richmond reference and observable outputs

The accepted abstract, five meetings, original Richmond paper, available corpus documents, professor briefings, repository implementation and historical artifacts were reviewed. A reading-coverage record distinguishes actual text/data review from binary/cache inventory and incomplete visual review. All 766 deduplicated long narrative fields from 16 historical verification versions were read. Inaccessible supplements and missing full texts remain acknowledged.

Created the official-findings account, cited method/verification protocol, historical-output correction record, explicit 18-branch reference and a current-run guide. Added continuity instructions in AGENTS.md and refreshed CLAUDE.md/README. Historical submissions remain unchanged; notices on older design/result summaries direct readers to the audit.

Implemented an isolated typed evidence pipeline: source hashes and pages; extraction with inference labels; deterministic quotation location and source-line selection repair; critic coverage checks; reified evidence graph; Jaccard/Louvain grouping; BM25 return-to-source retrieval; bounded programme-theory refinement; frozen-output external comparison; correctly serialized matrices; and independent human coder/adjudication exports. Fixed the legacy CSV generator's dictionary-row defect without silently replacing submitted files.

A three-paper pilot exposed citation typography and index-coverage issues. The clean full run in outputs/runs/evidence-20260910-full then completed 19 extraction responses and 17 source audits: 86 findings, 83 eligible. It stopped on provider HTTP 429 credit_balance_exhausted. There is no new final programme theory or comparison score. A directly observed invalid S015 source-line range was preserved and now fails closed at finding level. Nineteen tests pass; deterministic checks confirm 500 located spans agree with original text offsets, CSV row values/counts and integrity of a separately labelled partial graph. These are engineering checks, not human validation.

Readable actual output: outputs/runs/evidence-20260910-full/progress.html. Portable tables: partial_evidence_matrix.csv (86 rows), paper_progress.csv (28 records), comparison_plan.csv (18 reference rows with unexecuted verdicts blank). The partial graph has 902 nodes, 3290 edges and four retrieval groups from 83 eligible findings. It has no generated community summaries. The partial HTML was checked in headless Chrome; research PDFs were rendered and visually inspected. Cost estimates for completed calls: USD 3.1133 clean attempt plus USD 1.4252 pilot; four unresolved requests retain reservations.

Next executable step: restore API credit, inspect CURRENT_RUN_RESULTS.md and failure.json, then resume the same run with the explicit --retry-unfinished flag. Complete remaining audits, synthesis/refinement and external comparison; inspect the report and source evidence; arrange actual independent expert review. The pending API-credit question and Pony Tail installation-path question must not be mistaken for answered questions. PowerShell/Python was used because Pony Tail was not available in the exposed tools/searches.

## 2026-09-23 - Restored scope, completed machine baseline and prepared independent review

The owner renewed the end-to-end objective, confirmed replenished API credit, and said that two reviewers are not available yet: prepare review materials first. The accepted proposal, original Richmond text/figures and July 24 meeting were revisited. The 47-concept/40-relation and before/after-human requirements remain explicit alongside the 18-branch comparison. The requirements/acceptance record does not equate this baseline with the proposal's full trained/graph architecture.

Implemented immutable offline inspection snapshots of real historical Parquet and new evidence-run records; searchable entities, relations, findings, graph neighborhoods, theories and comparisons retain provenance and source navigation. Implemented offline preflight using exact request hashes, raw-versus-parsed response checking and reproducible paper audits. Production synthesis input now explicitly selects scientific fields, excluding local paths and review metadata. Cached extraction requests stayed identical. Primary literature informed a conditional semantic-assertion contract; that extension remains unimplemented, not claimed achieved by attribution edges.

Preflight reproduced the 46 prior calls/17 audits and then all 71 extraction/audit calls/28 audits. The four old unresolved requests were archived before explicit retry. The credit failure and partial progress/graph artifacts were preserved in execution history. API calls completed, yielding 180 findings, 174 eligible. The six excluded findings remain visible. The baseline synthesis/comparison process (tool session 68346) then exited 0, producing six communities, nine frozen provisional theory statements after one refinement pass, and 18 comparisons. The theory hash is d0489f641746eeb0389343e28c0db521e441e582ff98bf8fcfb1cb0ca81bdf7f. No pipeline process is intentionally left live.

Raw AI comparison counts are 14 partial/four not_recovered/zero equivalent. Post-run checking found findings outside selected theory evidence in RC04/RC05/RC11/RC12; RC11 selected no theory. The baseline validator restricted that linkage only for full equivalence. The original responses remain unchanged. Inspection v4 flags these rows; the counts must not be treated as validated recovery scores. Further assistant review identified an unsupported study-family claim in PT02, a potentially excessive necessity claim in PT05 and comparator qualifications requiring care in PT04. BASELINE_REVIEW_20260923.md records these concerns; none is relabelled as independent human judgment.

Prepared reference-ratification packets for 47 concepts, 40 relations and 18 branches (nine forms). Prepared a separate source-support packet for all 180 findings and nine theories (six forms), withholding critic/eligibility/comparison verdicts. The completed baseline also exports the configuration comparison matrix and separate blind coder forms. All human decisions remain blank. No human precision, recall, kappa or intervention benefit is claimed.

Actual outputs: outputs/runs/inspection-20260923-v4/index.html; outputs/runs/evidence-20260910-full/report.html and JSON/CSV artifacts; reference-review-20260923-v1/index.html; source-review-20260923-v1/index.html. Earlier inspection snapshots are preserved. The independent engineering report checked 97 request/response records, 1,100 located source spans, theory IDs/hash, actual CSV counts and recorded the four comparison-link warnings. Browser checks verified records, theory-to-finding links, warning display, source links, forms and absence of severe console errors. Twenty-two repository tests pass, with the existing missing pytest-asyncio configuration warning; targeted Ruff F/I passes. No engineering result establishes scientific validity.

Clean-run completed-call estimate: USD 13.5529 (September 23 increment USD 10.4396); separate pilot USD 1.4252. Clean-run ledger including unresolved reservations: USD 15.1265. These are configured token estimates, not account billing. Models returned 36 GPT-5.5-2026-04-23 and 61 GPT-5.4-mini-2026-03-17 responses. Pony Tail was not found in exposed tools, local plugin/skill filename searches or plugin-directory search; its installation path remains requested. Execution used PowerShell/Python.

Next executable work: correct evaluator scope in a distinct evaluation version; implement/evaluate source-led conditional semantic assertions and 47/40 system scoring; preserve inference, source support, comparator/time and study-family provenance; prepare versioned human edits and later controlled experiments. Human review needs actual appointed reviewers. Missing source texts/supplements, current-PDF regeneration and proposal-method reconciliation remain unresolved. This is substantial completed baseline work, not completion of the full research objective. Current authoritative records are RESEARCH_AUDIT_STATUS.md and CURRENT_RUN_RESULTS.md; historical submissions are untouched.

## 2026-09-23 - Scoped evaluation implementation and offline semantic extension

The previous goal turn was verified progress, not a wait: baseline completion, inspection artifacts and diagnosed comparison defects changed the next action. This continuation reread the complete objective and authoritative status, then implemented a separate evaluator for the frozen theory. Equivalent/partial/contradictory verdicts require selected theories and linked findings; positive dimensional matches require exact theory anchors. The validator quarantines invalid rows without changing model verdicts. A separate matrix/HTML exporter and code/input/prompt hashes preserve the distinction from the original evaluation. Tests reproduce outside-theory partial matches, absent-theory recovery claims, changed quotation polarity and inconsistent no-counterpart matches.

The new evaluation-20260923-v2 run attempted its first request and received provider HTTP 429 credit_balance_exhausted at 10:55:41Z. Process exited 1, zero completed responses, net recorded charge USD 0. The baseline's 97 calls and all outputs remain unchanged. The owner was asked about replenishment; no answer is inferred. The exact request/error, reservation reversal, failure checkpoint and explicit resume instructions are preserved. This is a new credit interruption, not a claim that the earlier full baseline failed.

Continued offline primary-literature research on Nye et al.'s evidence extraction, Luan et al.'s SciIE/SciERC and Wadden et al.'s DyGIE++ informed an explicit semantic assertion method. Implemented typed source entities and conditional assertions, distinct relation evidence, endpoint/quote checks, no-statistical-difference versus harm checks, and measured-versus-inferred consistency checks. Statistical increase/decrease and educational benefit/harm are separate fields. No canonical merging, trained NER/RE or semantic extraction API execution is claimed. The contract and its limitations are documented in SEMANTIC_ASSERTION_METHOD.md.

Validation: 32 tests pass with the existing asyncio configuration warning; targeted Ruff F/I checks pass. These are structural/engineering tests, not human semantic validation. Next: resume scoped evaluation only after credit restoration; continue offline extraction/audit implementation and updated research artifacts. The larger objective remains active and incomplete; absent human raters and unexecuted scientific experiments remain explicit.

The offline artifact update then produced output/pdf/Research_Method_and_Verification_20260923.pdf (19 pages), consolidating the updated method, semantic assertion method, evaluation-v2 protocol and concrete baseline review. The builder now preserves separate list items, adds page footers and uses appropriate widths for the nine-theory ID table. The older PDFs are unchanged. The bundled Python/ReportLab runtime and Poppler were used; all pages were rendered and visually inspected, with detailed inspection of changed lists/tables. A manifest verifies all four Markdown input hashes, builder hash and final PDF hash. No new API responses or human judgments were introduced by this artifact work.

## 2026-09-23 - Source-led semantic runner and frozen offline pilot

The preceding conversational turn rechecked existing packets and clarified their use but did not implement new work. This continuation reread the full objective and research status, revisited the accepted abstract, July 24 relation/human-intervention instructions and original Richmond text, then implemented the missing source-led entity/conditional-assertion runner. It uses frozen source pages and explicit metadata whitelists, with no reference inventory or prior finding/critic output supplied to extraction. Joint source extraction is followed by a separate AI source critic covering every typed ID exactly once. Admission requires source/structural checks and critic support; relations also require admitted endpoints. Hypotheses retain their provenance and human approval stays null. All candidates, including rejected/uncertain ones, remain exported.

Added qualified graph records, source/study-family metadata, faithful JSON/CSV exports and searchable HTML with readable condition/comparator/time/direction/inference fields, quotations and source-page anchors. Frozen text pages are explicitly distinguished from PDF facsimiles. Preparation is offline by default; paid calls require --execute. Code, schema, prompts, source snapshots, configuration and packet identities are recorded; changes require a new run. The prepared pilot inherits the shared USD 50 ceiling and prior baseline/pilot/evaluation ledgers, with no API calls made here.

Prepared outputs/runs/semantic-20260923-pilot-v1 for S006/S015/S026, selected as a development pilot informed by prior conditional-effect, perception and comparator/time failures. Its machine stage is prepared_not_executed, with no generated semantic observations. The full 28-source snapshot is retained; only three selected packets are model inputs. Baseline artifacts and evaluator-v2 code/dependencies were verified unchanged. No credit-restoration response is assumed; no process is left running.

Validation: 45 repository tests pass, including 13 semantic-runner cases; one pre-existing asyncio configuration warning remains. An initial end-to-end test caught Windows CRLF conversion causing packet hash mismatch; explicit UTF-8 byte serialization fixed it before pilot preparation. Targeted Ruff F/I checks pass. Headless Chrome exercised clearly synthetic records, record/source anchors, search and the actual prepared-source pages without severe errors; the synthetic screenshot was visually inspected. All 20 raw PDF hashes, metadata identity and three packet hashes match. outputs/research_audit/semantic-preparation-20260923.json records these engineering observations, not scientific validation.

SEMANTIC_EXTRACTION_RUNBOOK.md gives exact continuation instructions and distinguishes the new implementation from the frozen dated PDF edition. Next executable paid work after credit restoration: run and inspect the frozen pilot; resume evaluation v2 separately. Next offline work: canonical-equivalence proposals and linked concept/relation evaluation with explicit source support and unratified-reference status, followed by synthesis integration and controlled comparisons. Actual human intervention, broader proposal components and full scientific evaluation remain uncompleted; the goal is active.

## 2026-09-23 - Primary-source audit of the 47/40 reference and historical chains

Previous goal turn made concrete implementation/preparation progress. With API execution still unavailable, this continuation read the full objective and current status, revisited professor architecture/evaluation and July 24 verification instructions, and audited the actual historical reference against Richmond. Figures 2/3 were rendered from the original PDF and inspected visually; relevant result/limitations/conclusion passages were read. All 47 concepts, 40 relations and five historical chains received explicit assistant-authored notes, source locators and proposed qualifications. The original reference and human ratification forms were not edited.

The audit documents E01's population role, E19's summary-placeholder status, E21's compound response/outcome phrase, E43's explicit local Mresponse label, R17's ambiguous polarity, R11/R28's unestablished serial response links, and R37-R40's compressed paths missing mediators. It also records old-chain cross-context mixing and omissions from the finite 47-concept inventory. These are source-based assistant proposals, not human judgments. All 40 old triples omit dedicated qualifiers; the audit does not infer that all 40 are false. The interpretation of recovery scores must preserve these distinctions.

Implemented scripts/build_reference_audit.py as a version-checked assembler of the explicit notes. Generated outputs/runs/reference-audit-20260923-v1/index.html and reference_audit.json in a new directory, with all input hashes and unchanged originals. Coverage/HTML checks verified 92 distinct entries, blank human fields, valid page links, search and E43/R17 anchors; headless Chrome reported no severe errors. Example screenshots were visually reviewed. QA evidence: outputs/research_audit/reference-audit-20260923-qa.json. Ruff F/I passes. No scientific pipeline code changed and no additional API calls or human ratings occurred.

REFERENCE_STANDARD_AUDIT.md explains why reference repair must be versioned separately from improvements to generated output, and why unaided initial ratification should not show these assistant proposals. The 18-branch reference remains provisional and does not replace the 47/40 task. Next safe work is linked concept/relation comparison with qualified assertions and explicit unratified-reference status; actual semantic extraction and evaluator-v2 execution require credit restoration, while genuine ratification/intervention requires reviewers. The full goal remains active and incomplete.

## 2026-09-23 - Reference-to-actual-output correspondence review

Previous turn completed a source-based reference audit. This continuation reread the objective/current state and implemented correspondence_review.py plus its HTML template, with separate legacy and completed-semantic input modes. The actual delivered packet is outputs/runs/correspondence-review-20260923-legacy-v2: 47 concepts/40 relations on the reference side, 517 entity/439 relation records from the historical inspection snapshot on the system side. Users can search/select actual IDs, view real endpoints and CMOC narrative, open original PDFs where available and inspect complete frozen source pages. No automatic match suggestions or prior critic/confidence judgments are supplied. Original generated labels/narratives remain the evaluation objects.

Prepared six separate A/B/adjudication CSVs with only reference IDs filled. The importer checks complete reference populations, known/unique candidate IDs, actual instance-connected paths within one paper/configuration, explicit equivalent dimensions, attributable reviewer/date/time/rationale and paired reviews before adjudication. It rejects prepared semantic output rather than interpreting empty unexecuted arrays as missed recovery. It leaves ratified-reference recovery/source precision null because this reference is unratified and reference-centered forms do not cover all generated assertions. Structural checks are not judgments of truth or authentication of reviewer identity.

Actual-data QA discovered one edge (S008-cmoc-458176-r-1de6ea) whose two entity instances normalize to the same canonical ID. The earlier inspector's set-membership check did not prove a unique directed mapping. The original edge stays unchanged. V2 retains both ambiguous candidate endpoints for inspection and disallows treating the unresolved structure as a selected matched relation; V1 preparation is preserved. Historical edges have no dedicated relation quotation. Rechecking endpoint quotes located 494 of 517 against frozen September text; this does not establish entailment or identity with the original July input text.

Validation: 56 repository tests passed; the 11 new focused tests passed again after the ambiguity-display update. The pre-existing asyncio configuration warning remains; targeted Ruff F/I passes. Browser checks verified all reference/candidate counts, search, selection, source-page expansion and ambiguous endpoint display without severe console errors. The side-by-side view was visually inspected; all six forms remain blank and input hashes match. QA evidence: outputs/research_audit/correspondence-review-20260923-qa.json. No paid calls, actual human ratings or production artifact changes occurred. CORRESPONDENCE_REVIEW_GUIDE.md contains exact usage/validation commands and limitations. Actual new semantic extraction/comparison still awaits credit restoration; human ratification/intervention awaits reviewers. The full objective remains active.

## 2026-09-23 - Attributed synthesis revisions and before/after preparation

Previous goal turn made correspondence-workbench progress. This continuation read the objective/status, inspected the old few-shot feedback store and source-review forms, and revisited the accepted human-feedback proposal and July 24 manual-intervention request. The old wrong/correct/note store alone does not provide source-versioned edit attribution or evidence of measured human benefit. No existing database or feedback prompts were changed.

Implemented interventions.py for empty preparation and genuinely supplied attributed synthesis edits. Add/replace/withdraw operations preserve original theory records, source/finding/reference hashes, exact submissions, before/after events and code snapshots in a distinct sibling run. Splitting uses explicit withdrawal and new IDs. Summary changes have their own hash/attribution; inherited summaries are flagged for review. Stale, unknown, duplicate, empty and no-op changes are rejected. Human, human-with-AI-assistance and AI contributions remain distinguished; names do not authenticate identities and edited theories retain pending human approval. The workflow edits output and does not train models or claim RLHF.

Prepared outputs/runs/intervention-preparation-20260923-v2 with all nine actual theories and an empty ledger; zero real changes. V1 is preserved as an earlier display checkpoint. The revised UI shows readable labelled fields, keeps raw JSON behind a disclosure and highlights changed fields in before/after reports. No human contribution was manufactured and no baseline theory was rewritten. Actual application was exercised only with clearly labelled synthetic test fixtures under tmp/.

Validation: 66 repository tests passed with the pre-existing asyncio configuration warning; targeted Ruff F/I checks pass. Synthetic cases cover provenance/source preservation, AI attribution, stale/no-op/conflicting edits, invalid evidence, timezone handling, splitting and overwrite refusal. Browser/visual checks verified nine real preparation records, the PT01 original source-report anchor and a synthetic readable before/after report; no severe errors. Final QA: outputs/research_audit/intervention-preparation-20260923-v2-qa.json. Baseline/source/reference hashes match and no API calls were made.

ATTRIBUTED_INTERVENTION_PROTOCOL.md defines the fixed-reference/rubric before/after comparison and separates reference repair, output intervention, independent validation and model training. Actual human editing, paired/blinded evaluation and measured gains remain pending; the full research goal is not complete. Paid pilot/evaluator execution still awaits credit restoration. Offline canonical/graph integration and controlled experiment preparation remain available next work.
