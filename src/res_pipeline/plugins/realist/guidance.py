"""Extraction guidance — the professor's three emphasised mechanisms, kept LIGHT.

The professor repeatedly asks for three things around the Literature Knowledge Graph:

  A. **Seed-guided extraction** — the researcher supplies seed examples of big concepts
     (from the IPT); the extractor uses them as few-shot *naming* references.
  B. **GraphRAG-in-extraction** — the big concepts / frequent concepts ALREADY in the
     LKG are retrieved during extraction so a new study's labels stay consistent with
     earlier studies (e.g. a fresh "novice overload" aligns to the existing "Cognitive
     load overwhelm" instead of spawning a near-duplicate node).
  C. **HITL feedback → few-shot → re-run** — human corrections recorded at any checkpoint
     are stored and replayed to the agent as few-shot examples, so the agent LEARNS from
     the human and its next run reflects the correction.

CRITICAL EMPIRICAL CONSTRAINT: a heavy theory block injected into per-paper extraction was
measured to SUPPRESS CMOC yield and quote-support (a MetaGPT-style dilution). Everything
here is therefore ADDITIVE, BOUNDED, and explicitly NON-RESTRICTIVE — it steers naming and
cross-study consistency, never what a paper is allowed to yield. All of it is gated by
``config/guidance.yaml`` so a cheap 2-3 paper pilot can A/B each mechanism before a full run.
