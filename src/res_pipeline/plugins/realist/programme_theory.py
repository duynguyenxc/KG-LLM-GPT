"""Programme Theory Composer: from motifs + contradictions to a realist theory.

Produces the final realist artifact in the same genre as Richmond et al. (2020):
context-indexed theory sections, each with an italicisable CMOC statement, the
supporting demi-regularities, study counts, and explicit handling of
contradictions (with their interpretive resolutions from HITL-3).

The composer LLM is constrained to the evidence it is given: every claim must
cite study IDs from the supplied motifs; the schema rejects sections without
citations. Human sign-off (HITL-4) is recorded before the theory is marked final.
