"""The retroduction loop (Gap 2) — realist synthesis's defining iterative rhythm.

Richmond: "studies identified earlier were re-analysed in light of theories arising
from papers included later in the review" (L253-255); the professor: "a seed, then
an iterative modifier, then the human exam."

Each round:
  1. REFINE — an LLM reflection compares the current programme theory to the IPT
     hypotheses and records which were confirmed / refined / rejected (a new IPT
     version — the "modifier"), which then feeds back into extraction prompts.
  2. RE-READ — the studies the Consistency Checker flagged or the verifier scored
     low are re-extracted under the refined theory (the "re-analysis of earlier
     studies"); optional (paid) via ``reextract``.
  3. RE-SYNTHESISE — normalisation, community detection, demi-regularities, and the
     programme theory are recomputed.
Converges when the flagged set is empty (or unchanged) or ``max_iter`` is reached.
The human still signs off the final theory (HITL-4) — sovereignty is preserved.
