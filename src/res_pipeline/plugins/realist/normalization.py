"""Entity Normalization Agent: cluster synonymous entity labels across studies.

Cross-study synthesis requires knowing that "self-efficacy", "self-confidence
calibrated to performance" and "confidence" refer to one concept. This agent
canonicalizes entity instances per entity type:

  * exact/near-exact string matches are merged mechanically;
  * remaining labels are clustered by an LLM pass constrained to the labels it is
    given (it may only group and name, never invent members);
  * every instance receives a ``canonical_id``; the mapping is persisted and
    audited (a merge is an analytic decision under RAMESES II transparency).

Canonical concepts are the nodes of the cross-study knowledge graph;
per-study instances (with their quotes/spans) remain the provenance layer.
