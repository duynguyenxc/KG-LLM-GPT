"""Title/abstract screening agent: recall-first, dual-model vote, HITL-routed.

Design (ARCHITECTURE D4, SOTA_REPORT Q2/Q4):
  * The rubric is rendered from ``config/protocol.yaml`` — researcher-defined
    decision logic, never free-styled by the model (professor requirement).
  * Posture is recall-first: the system prompt instructs the model that missing
    a relevant study is far worse than a false include; borderline → 'uncertain'.
  * Two model families vote (``screening_primary`` + ``screening_second_vote``).
    Combination rule: any 'include' vote → include; both 'exclude' → exclude;
    anything else → 'uncertain' routed to HITL-1.
  * Every decision (each voter's and the combined one) is persisted with its
    rationale and confidence for the audit trail.

- Population — include: {e["population"]["include"]} Exclude: {e["population"]["exclude"]}
- Intervention — include: {e["intervention"]["include"]} Exclude: {e["intervention"]["exclude"]}
- Focus — include: {e["focus"]["include"]}
- Outcomes — include: {e["outcomes"]["include"]}
- Timeframe: published in or after {e["timeframe"]["published_from"]}.
- Realist relevance test: {e["relevance_test"]}

DECISION POLICY (STRICT):
- This screening is RECALL-FIRST: wrongly excluding a relevant study is far more \
costly than wrongly including an irrelevant one.
- 'include' if the study plausibly meets the criteria and could contribute to theory \
building about how educational interventions develop clinical reasoning.
- 'exclude' ONLY when the study clearly fails a criterion (wrong population AND no \
undergraduate component, no educational intervention/technique, or no relation to \
clinical reasoning development).
- 'uncertain' whenever the title/abstract gives insufficient information — a human \
adjudicator will resolve these. Do not guess.
Cite the specific criteria in your rationale."""
