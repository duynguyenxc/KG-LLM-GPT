"""Build a distractor pool and run the screening precision/specificity test.

Richmond assessed 149 full texts and included 28; the 121 excluded records would be
the ideal distractors but are not published. To test whether the screening agent is
DISCRIMINATING (rejects irrelevant papers) rather than merely sensitive (recall on
the 28), this module assembles a controlled distractor pool from Europe PMC — real
papers that are topically adjacent to clinical-reasoning education but violate a
KNOWN eligibility criterion, so "correct rejection" is well defined.

Distractor categories (each with the criterion it violates):
  * postgraduate     — residents/fellows (violates 'undergraduate' population)
  * non_reasoning    — medical education not about clinical reasoning (violates focus)
  * no_intervention  — descriptive/observational, no educational intervention
  * off_topic        — clearly outside scope (violates focus/population)

Ground truth: every distractor is expected 'exclude'. The screening agent runs on the
mixed pool (28 benchmark + distractors); we report recall on the 28 and specificity /
precision on the distractors. Caveat (reported, not hidden): a small number of
distractors may be genuinely eligible-but-missed-by-Richmond; flagged for human check.
