"""Expert reference coding of the per-paper CMOC gold standard.

The RA and professor delegated this coding to the pipeline author because it
requires deep, careful reading of every Richmond study against Richmond's own
published entity vocabulary (E01-E47). To keep it as defensible as possible:

  * Coding is BLIND to the pipeline's extraction (the paper text is read fresh;
    the pipeline's CMOCs are never shown to the coder) — this avoids the
    AI-adjudicating-its-own-output circularity that made the old xlsx unusable.
  * The coder is constrained to Richmond's published E01-E47 vocabulary, so the
    reference is anchored to the human benchmark, not a free invention.
  * The output is explicitly labelled an EXPERT REFERENCE CODING (AI-assisted),
    to be spot-ratified by a human before publication — not claimed as an
    independent human gold standard.

Two model families are used to reduce shared-model bias: the extraction pipeline
uses gpt-5.5; this reference coder uses a different tier (``gold_coder`` in
models.yaml). Per-paper fidelity of the pipeline is then computed against this
reference (precision / recall / F1 over Richmond E-codes, per study).
